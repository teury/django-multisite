Thanks for downloading django-multisite.
 
To install it, run the following command inside this directory:
 
    python setup.py install
 
Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``django-multisite``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Subversion checkout.
exelente
